			<p>My name is Nicole and I am currently 20 years old. I stared my transitioning process on June 2017 and by far it has been one of the best decisions I have ever taken in my entire life. I believe I have medium to high porosity hair and 3A to 3B curls; I also have fine to medium and low to medium density.
		<br>
		    Taking care of my hair isn't just a routine, is my day a day; it has become part of me and part of the things that mae me happy. Therefore, I want to encourage others to give theirselves the chance to love and accept their natural hair, and join me in this amazing process!</p>

			 <p>Life becomes simpler and lighter. When you love yourself more then things simply become lighter and easier. You won’t make as many mountains out of molehills (or out of plain air) as you used to. Or beat yourself up or drag yourself down over mistakes or temporary setbacks.
			 You’ll have more inner stability and self-sabotage less. When your opinion of yourself goes up then you’ll stop trying to get so much validation and attention from other people.</p>
